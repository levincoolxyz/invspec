# 2d discrete inverse spectral problem

goal of this project is to calculate an approximate solution to the classic (Laplace-Beltrami) inverse spectral problem for discrete surfaces.

Included is a suite of MATLAB codes implementing the naive direct gradient descent approach.

some codes here (on (sphere) meshes optimization and a demo of spherical harmonics) are not written by me.

project envisioned, advised, and supervised by Prof. Etienne Vouga and Prof. Keenan Crane
