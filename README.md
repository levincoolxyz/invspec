# 2d discrete inverse spectral problem

goal of this project is to calculate an approximate solution to the classic (Laplace-Beltrami) inverse spectral problem for discrete surfaces.

what is included here is a suite of MATLAB codes implementing the naive direct gradient descent approach.

some codes included here (on obtaining meshes of sphere, on spherical harmonics) are not written by me.

project advised and supervised by Prof. Etienne Vouga and Prof. Keenan Crane
