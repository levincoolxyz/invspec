(conformalized) mean curvature flow of target mesh onto \"spherical\" mesh with a target set of conformal factors\r\n\r\nto do: rescale volume? spectral convergence?\r\n\r\n2. descent search for some conformal factors that optimize spectral similarity\r\n\r\n3. fit conformal factors on sphere back to a resulting mesh that optimize edge lengths targets from the factors\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n![ani#1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/levincoolxyz/invspec/master/i3_300_t2_abs(Y33(v))_e0.1-1p0.5.gif \"discrete Y33 spherical harmonic target with varying percent of eigenvalues used\")\r\n![ani#2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/levincoolxyz/invspec/master/i3_300_t2_abs(Y32(v))_e0.1p0.5-2.gif \"discrete Y32 spherical harmonic target with varying amount of deformation\")\r\n\r\nAiming for cMCF spectrum instead\r\n![ani#3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/levincoolxyz/invspec/master/i2_300_t2_abs(Y32(v))_e0.1p0.5-2.gif \"discrete Y32 spherical harmonic target with varying amount of deformation\")\r\n\r\nTests with bunny\r\n\r\n*coming soon*\r\n",
